# Overview
Socialmeter is a flexible, extensible sentiment analysis framework.

It is built to provide a baseline framework for executing sentiment analysis,
while maintaining a level of customization that allows tuning
to achieve more accurate classification possible. 

All modules are built to be flexible to the needs of the user, and
are built with this in mind. The class hierarchy is designed to allow
users to drop-in their own modules that extend the baseline modules.

# Usage
(Currently under construction)

# Future Improvements
## Concrete Tasks
- [ ] Further constriction of the `SMeter` class definition
  - [ ] Removal of the `Module` class
  - [ ] Removal and replacement of the `Link` class for more specific use cases
- [ ] Unit testing of feature extractors and preprocessor extractors
- [ ] Better ensemble support
- [ ] Different `SMeter` objects that all feed into one larger `SMeter` objects
- [ ] Better Facebook Graph API implementation and support
- [ ] Option for preprocessors to 'replace' the text attribute for data
- [ ] Better abstraction for column format in conjunction with the `SMeter` object
		and input modules
- [ ] Built-in powerset grid search for feature extractors
- [ ] Remove `FeatureExtractorModule` class and only use the `FeatureExtractor` objects
		handled by a single class.

## Directional Improvements
- What do Data Scientists think of this?
- What do Programmers think of this?
- Do any other sites provide a service like the TwitterStreamAPI?
